Linear least-squares data fitting without calculus

It's hard to overstate the importance of linear least-squares data fitting, one
of the most widely-used computational methods.  Linear least-squares data
fitting also exhibits many remarkable statistical properties that you can learn
about in stats courses.  Applications range from astronomy to zymology and
everything in between including finance, health care, engineering, advertising,
logistics, and many more.

This note outlines ordinary linear least-squares data fitting without calculus
or statistics, using only the tools of college algebra. I wrote this for my
college algebra class at Garrett College in the Appalachian mountains of
western Maryland. It's intended to supplement standard college algebra courses.

The fact that such a useful method can be developed in a simple way illustrates
the modern relevance and explanatory power of basic college algebra.
